        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>I'm a web developer and have been living in Tokyo since May, 2022. I've always had an inquisitive nature which has led me to study a wide variety of topics. In December 2022, I completed the <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo">üóºLeWagon Bootcamp</a> (9-week intensive coding program). Before this, I obtained a very unique combo of a MSc in marketing and a BSc in zoology.
